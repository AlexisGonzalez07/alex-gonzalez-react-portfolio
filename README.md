# Alex Gonzalez React Portfolio
Welcome to my React Portfolio's repository. This project was developed using reusable components, styled with plain css using styled-components, and linked together using react-scroll. This repo was made due to a problem launching the application in the old repo found here [AG-Modern-React](https://github.com/AlexisGonzalez07/ag-modern-react). There, you can view the full commit history and development of this app.

## Design
This app was designed to be light on the eyes thanks to the dark-mode lover in me. With a sleek, clean look throughout, it is easy and enjoyable to explore the different secions of the page. <br>

There was a lot of time invested into making the site look appealing for big screens `(greater than 1100px)`, medium screens `(1100px to 992px)`, tablets `(992px to 768px)`, large phones `(768px to 576px)`, and smaller devices `(the rest)`. Max-widths, grid-template-areas, and flex-directions were adjusted for all components. You can view examples of grid-area manipulation for smaller screens under the AboutSection and EducationSection component folders. Examples of flexbox manipulation using media queries area easy to detect under the ProjectSection component folder.

## Growth
It's been 8 months `(as of April 2022)` since I decided I would learn to code, and I'm not ashamed to share my previous portfolios so you can see first-hand how far I've come as a developer, although I still have a long way to go.
